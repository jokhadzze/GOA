            <p>
                the clips im about to show you are from movie 'dangerously yours'. They show the painful side of love, but is there real love <br><br>
                no pain. 'Dangerously yours' quotes might have you concerned, cause they open humans' eyes as new feeling or feelings appears <br><br>
                their hearts. maybe fear? or dissapointement? hopelessness? On the the other hand love neve fails and if it did, it wasn't love.<br><br>
                I trully believe, once you fall in love with someone, you dont fall out of love. us, teenagers, we fall in love, and call that<br><br>
                person first love. If yall don't work out, it hurts, it feels like the life has ended, there's no point in keep going and hope <br><br>
                gradually fades. I don't know if it's gonna get bet better at some point, and I have no idead how to deal with pain . At some <br><br>
                point you stop living and just exist that lead to endless loop feeling guilt, pain, wothlessness, hopelessness, lonliness,<br><br>
                sadness and having thought of ending it all and that when fear of you actually doing something bad to youself steps in. <br><br>
                Everything i just said is what's been sitting in my mind for last few months, I could talk about this endlessly but I won't.<br><br>
