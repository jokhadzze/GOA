            <p>
                the clips im about to show you are from movie 'dangerously yours'. They show the painful side of love, but is there real love <br><br>
                with no pain. 'Dangerously yours' quotes might have you concerned, cause they open humans' eyes as new feeling or feelings appears <br><br>
                their hearts. maybe fear? or dissapointement? hopelessness? On the the other hand love never fails and if it did, it wasn't love.<br><br>
                I trully believe, once you fall in love with someone, you dont fall out of love. us, teenagers, we fall in love, and call that<br><br>
                person first love. If yall don't work out, it hurts, it feels like the life has ended, there's no point in keep going and hope <br><br>
                gradually fades. I don't know if it's gonna get better at some point, and I have no idea how to deal with pain. At some <br><br>
                point you stop living and just exist that leads to an endless loop feeling guilt, pain, wothlessness, hopelessness, lonliness,<br><br>
                sadness and having thought of ending it all and that when fear of you actually doing something bad to youself steps in. <br><br>
                Everything i just said is what's been sitting in my mind for last few months, I could talk about this endlessly but I won't.<br><br>
                Instead before going ahead and taking a look at my website click on this button below to see the message i left.<br><br>

                        "I love you, you may aswell take my heart,<br> <br>
                        it's already full of you" quote hits so <br><br>
                        hard, even harder when you can relate. <br><br>
                        These two clips are connected, the second <br><br>
                        one continues the first one. does it <br><br>
                        matter if they've only known each other <br><br>
                        for three weeks? No. Love has no time <br><br>
                        limits, his words are heartwarming, but <br><br>
                        she can't throw her country over love, <br><br>
                        "you've lost, you hear me? Lost!" <br><br>
                        How heartbreaking and devastating.<br><br>
                    </p>

                        how the roles switched, now he's the one mentioning<br><br>
                        country. The phrase of hers that stands out in my<br><br>
                        opinion is "yes, we are, aren't we?", it's even<br><br>
                        filled with more emotions and is the most meaningful<br><br>
                        to me. Also, is love really that close to hate?<br><br>
                        can't answer that in a few words. This topic might<br><br>
                        be discussed all over and over again, but is there a<br><br>
                        conclusion? how could Tarieli ever hate Nestan-Darejani<br><br>
                        or how could Avtandili ever hate Tinatini? what turns<br><br>
                        love into hatred? many questions and variety of <br><br>
                        answers. I won't go deeper into it. what about <br><br>
                        him choosing her to find her destany over his own<br><br>
                        feelings? I know the misery he goes through filled <br><br>
                        with devastating pain. He really proved that he loves<br><br>
                        her and would do anything for her. The love is pure.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        tv girl x dangerously yours. These two quotes are <br><br>
                        featured in the songs. The one in "Cigarettes Out <br><br>
                        The Window" is my favorite. here's the full thing:<br><br>
                        "You'll live a long time yet, an eternity without<br><br>
                        me. You will look into the faces of passers by<br><br>
                        hoping for something that will for an instant<br><br>
                        bring me back to you. You will find moonlit nights <br><br>
                        strangely empty, because wen you call my name through<br><br>
                        them, there will be no answer. Always your heart will <br><br>
                        be aching for me and your mind will give the doubt<br><br>
                        or consolation that you did a brave thing." Heaven<br><br>
                        knows how mesmerized I am by these words and never<br><br>
                        get tired of listening to them. I never mentioned <br><br>
                        the names of the characters, because this is not <br><br>
                        about them. I dont have enough words to describe<br><br>
                        how meaningful and touching his speech is to me.<br><br>
                        Must be painful hearing your name among those<br><br>
                        words of his. Realatable. No screen or page<br><br>
                        would fit my thoughts. The other qoute is featured <br><br>
                        in "Lovers Rock". Her wanting him to be among<br><br>
                        those few men she has kisses is a cherished gesture.<br><br>
                        I wouldn't call the reason foolish, I think it's<br><br>
                        rather heartfelt.
