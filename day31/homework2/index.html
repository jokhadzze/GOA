            <section><b><u><h2>about Monster anime/manga</h2></u></b></section>
            
            <p>The Monster anime series adapts Naoki Urasawa's manga of the same name. The 74-episode series was created by <br>
            Madhouse and broadcast on Nippon Television from April 7, 2004, to September 28, 2005. Directed by Masayuki <br>
            Kojima, it is a faithful adaptation of the entire story; essentially recreated shot for shot and scene for <br>
            scene compared to the original manga. The few subtle differences include short snippets of additional dialogue <br>
            and slight re-ordering of scenes in places.[citation needed] The series soundtrack is composed by Kuniaki Haishima. <br> 
            Dr. Kenzo Tenma is a young Japanese brain surgeon, working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in Düsseldorf, West Germany. <br>
            Tenma is dissatisfied with the political bias of the hospital in treating patients, and seizes the chance to change <br>
            things after a massacre brings fraternal twins Johan and Anna Liebert into the hospital. Johan has a gunshot wound to <br>
            his head, and Anna mutters about killing; Tenma operates on Johan instead of the mayor, who arrived later. Johan is <br>
            saved, but Mayor Roedecker dies; Tenma loses his social standing. Director Heinemann and the other doctors in Tenma's <br>
            way are mysteriously murdered, and both children disappear from the hospital. The police suspect Tenma, but they have <br>
            no evidence and can only question him. <br>

            Nine years later, Tenma is Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial. After saving a criminal named Adolf Junkers, Junkers <br> 
            mutters about a "monster." Tenma returns with a clock for Junkers, he finds the guard in front of Junkers' room dead <br>
            and Junkers gone. Following the trail to the construction site of a half-finished building near the hospital, Tenma <br>
            finds Junkers held at gunpoint. Junkers warns him against coming closer and pleads with him to run away. Tenma refuses, <br>
            and the man holding the gun is revealed to be Johan Liebert. Despite Tenma's attempts to reason with him, Johan shoots <br>
            Junkers. Telling Tenma he could never kill the man who saved his life, he walks off into the night, with Tenma too shocked <br>
            to stop him. <br>

            Tenma is suspected by the police, particularly BKA Inspector Lunge, and he tries to find more information about Johan. <br> 
            He soon discovers that the boy's sister is living a happy life as an adopted daughter; the only traces of her terrible <br>
            past are a few nightmares. Tenma finds Anna, who was subsequently named Nina by her adoptive parents, on her birthday; <br>
            he keeps her from Johan, but is too late to stop him from murdering her adoptive parents. Tenma eventually learns the <br>
            origins of this "monster": from the former East Germany's attempt to use a secret orphanage known as "511 Kinderheim" <br>
            to create perfect soldiers through psychological reprogramming, to the author of children's books used in a eugenics <br>
            experiment in the former Czechoslovakia. Tenma learns the scope of the atrocities committed by this "monster", and vows <br>
            to fix the mistake he made by ending Johan's life.</p> <br>

                <p>Kenzo Tenma (天馬 賢三, Tenma Kenzō) is a Japanese neurosurgeon working at Eisler Memorial Hospital in Düsseldorf. Little is <br>
                known of Tenma's childhood apart from his father and brother also being doctors and that his family ties grew weaker when he <br>
                left Japan for Germany. He is a humanitarian who cares about the lives of others, and his kindness influences those he meets. <br>
                His surgical skills earn him the position of chief neurosurgeon. He is engaged to Eva Heinemann, daughter of the hospital's <br>
                Director Heinemann. When a young boy with a bullet wound arrives in 1986, Tenma is about to operate when Chief of Surgery <br>
                Dr. Oppenheim and Director Heinemann tell him to work on the mayor, who came in later instead. After a crisis of conscience, <br>
                Tenma saves the life of the young boy who came in first while the mayor dies. At a banquet, Tenma asks for forgiveness from <br>
                Director Heinemann who forgives him while blacklisting him and appointing Dr. Boyer the new chief neurosurgeon. Eva also ends <br>
                their engagement. Weeks later, Tenma gets word from the police that Director Heinemann, Dr. Oppenheim and Dr. Boyer have been <br>
                mysteriously killed. The chairman of the board appoints Tenma Chief of Surgery and Eva tries to reconcile, but Tenma ignores her. <br>
                
                Nine years later, Tenma learns that the doctors' murders were committed by the boy he saved when the now-grown boy, Johan Liebert, <br>
                commits another right in front of him. Johan is also the mastermind of the serial murders of middle-aged couples throughout Germany. <br>
                Plagued by guilt, he resolves to find Johan and end the life of this "monster" he feels responsible for creating, while evading <br>
                Inspector Lunge, who suspects Tenma of the murders. In his quest to kill Johan, Tenma nearly succeeds several times only to have him <br> 
                slip away until their final confrontation in Ruhenheim. When Johan wants Tenma to kill him, he threatens Wim Knaup when the child's <br>
                drunk father mistakes Johan for a monster and shoots him. After Johan is flown to a hospital in a helicopter, Tenma treats him and is <br>
                cleared of all charges. He later joins Doctors Without Borders, visits Johan's mother, and visits the comatose Johan in a police hospital. <br>

                <p>Johan Liebert (ヨハン・リーベルト, Yohan Rīberuto) is the older twin son of the Lieberts, whose father Michael was an East German <br>
                trade advisor who defected to the West. He is the "monster" of the title and the principal antagonist of the series. The mystery <br>
                of his past is the focus of the plot. He is called a monster, the next Adolf Hitler and the devil himself. Johan Liebert was shot <br>
                in the head as a child when his parents were killed in their home, but saved from death by Dr. Tenma. He claims to love his twin <br>
                sister Anna, and has some loyalty to her. Johan has spent parts of his life in different places under different names. He possesses <br>
                charisma and intelligence but is also cunning, manipulative and deceitful; while he is seemingly kind, compassionate and loving to <br>
                children, he is actually cold, cruel and fundamentally incapable of empathy. He uses his talents to manipulate and corrupt others, <br>
                often with no apparent end than to cause suffering and destruction. His goal is to kill everyone that knows of his existence. He <br>
                identifies with other killers, discovering their secrets. After causing the death of Peter Čapek, he orchestrates the Ruhenheim <br>
                Massacre and has his final encounter with Tenma. When Johan threatens Wim to get Tenma to shoot him, Johan is shot by Wim's drunken <br>
                father, Herbert. He is flown to a hospital in a helicopter, with the bullet wound treated by Tenma. Comatose, he is <br>
                visited by Tenma in a police hospital. The final page shows his bed empty, ambiguously suggesting that Johan has escaped the hospital. <br>

                Johan frequently appears on lists of best villains in anime, manga, and fiction. Johan placed first in Paste's list of the "20 of the <br> 
                Greatest Villains in Anime", with Toussaint Egan saying that him the "Despite all that he was able to accomplish over the course of Naoki <br>
                Urasawa’s Monster — manipulating over fifty people to kill one another through suggestion alone, framing the man who saved his life for <br>
                murder, operating a massive money laundering operation at the heart of Germany, and coordinating a shadow network of killers to do his <br>
                bidding— Johan has no special abilities to speak of, save for intelligence. No magical notebook capable of killing anyone whose name is <br>
                written in its pages, no unholy totem gifting him with the blessing of divine fate, nothing. He is a human being, no more and no less, <br>
                and that is precisely what makes him so terrifying." <br>

                <p>Anna Liebert (アンナ・リーベルト, Anna Rīberuto) is Johan's twin sister, the only physically unharmed survivor of the night her parents <br>
                were killed and her brother was shot in what appeared to be a botched burglary. After she and Johan disappeared, she was adopted by <br>
                the Fortner family from Heidelberg where she was named Nina Fortner (ニナ・フォルトナー, Nina Forutonā). Nina is a sweet, kind, loving, <br>
                hardworking and intelligent young woman. She seemed to have a happy life as a law student at Heidelberg University and a practitioner <br>
                of aikido, but discovers there are parts of her past she does not remember. At first, she had amnesia due to the psychological trauma <br>
                of the attack. She lives in peace until Johan contacts her on their 20th birthday and has the Fortners killed. She then pursues Johan, <br>
                with different methods and for a different reason than Tenma does. While Nina does not share her brother's psychosis, they have similar <br>
                fears linked to their past. While Nina is primarily a pacifist, she will threaten (or kill) someone if she feels it necessary or to <br>
                protect others. During a hypnosis session with Dr. Gillen, her personality changes and she attacks him. When she fully regains her <br>
                memories, it is revealed that she was the twin taken by Franz Bonaparta to his Red Rose Mansion, when he committed mass murder. Bonaparta <br> 
                then told her to forget what she saw and to run away and not "become monsters." She is also the one who shot Johan in the head at his <br>
                own urging, after he killed the Lieberts. She is present at the Ruhenheim Massacre, where she tells her brother that she forgives him and <br>
                tries to dissuade Tenma from shooting Johan. At the end of the series, Nina is graduating from college and plans to attend law school. <br>

                <p>Heinrich Lunge (ハインリッヒ・ルンゲ, Hainrihhi Runge)[3] is a BKA detective assigned to the murder case at Eisler Memorial Hospital. <br> 
                Lunge initially thinks Johan was imagined by Tenma as an excuse, but progresses to the belief Tenma suffers a split personality; with <br>
                Tenma trying to force "Johan" to reveal himself. He seems devoid of emotion, which allows him to commit himself to every case on which <br>
                he works. His devotion to his work comes at the expense of his personal life; during the series, his wife and pregnant daughter leave him. <br>
                What he loves most is his job; Lunge missed a chance to meet his grandson for the first time to see Tenma's friends from Japan instead. <br>
                He expresses some regret; during his fight with Roberto he seems angry to hear Roberto say how happy his wife was with another man, and <br>
                his grandson saw that man as his grandfather. Lunge has an excellent memory, "entering data" into his mind by making typing gestures with <br>
                his hands. His toughness drives a murder suspect to suicide, prompting his superiors to remove Lunge from all his cases. After the University <br>
                of Munich fire, Lunge learns that Johan really exists. He then takes a "holiday" in Prague to track down Franz Bonaparta, author of a book <br>
                which may reveal Johan's origins. Lunge ends up in Ruhenheim, meeting Grimmer and Tenma; apologizing to the latter for his mistakes, he heads <br>
                off to a showdown with Roberto. Both are wounded in the shootout; Lunge survives, while Roberto dies of his wounds. While being carried away <br>
                by a stretcher to the hospital, he blames Roberto for the Ruhenheim Massacre stating that Roberto was essentially responsible for what happened <br>
                there. It is unknown why, but it is hinted that he does so to protect Tenma. After the Ruhenheim Massacre, Lunge visits Wolfgang Grimmer's grave <br>
                along with Jan Suk and Fritz Verdemann. He tells them he is a professor at a police academy, and has rekindled his relationship with his daughter. <br>

                <p>Dieter (ディーター, Dītā) is a young boy Tenma encounters in his search for Johan. When Tenma first meets him, he is an orphan under <br>
                the care of a man named Hartmann; Tenma later discovers that Dieter is physically and psychologically abused by Hartmann. Hartmann <br>
                plans to make Dieter into another Johan by applying the same conditioning used in the 511 Kinderheim orphanage, but with no success. <br>
                Dieter later becomes happier after being saved by Tenma from Hartmann's abuse. Dieter follows Tenma in his search for Johan to prevent <br>
                Tenma from becoming a murderer because he is fond of him. He later teams up with Nina to help her find out more about her past and give <br>
                her moral support when her traumatic memories resurface (since he was also subjected to similar abuse). Dieter seems to have absorbed <br>
                some of Tenma's beliefs and optimism about life when he meets an injured young boy named Martin influenced by Johan to be more like the <br>
                latter. The young boy recites what he heard Johan say about life, death and fear, and tries to tempt Dieter to walk along the ledge of a <br>
                building with his eyes closed. Dieter refuses, saying he wants to live, to experience new things and see the faces of the people he loves; <br>
                he repeats what he heard Tenma say: "Tomorrow will be better"-("Tomorrow will be a good day" in the English dub). Dieter helps Nina find out <br>
                more about her past. By the end of the series he reunites with Otto Heckel, who tells Dieter to give information he dug up on where the mother <br>
                of the Liebert twins is to Tenma.<br>

                independent, superficial, bossy, loud, demanding, and manipulative. She is also cruel, taunting, demeaning, and hates not having her way. <br>
                Although she claims to love Tenma, she sometimes treated him cruelly. After her father demotes Tenma for disobeying the former's orders, <br>
                she callously breaks up with him. Director Heinemann's murder takes a toll on her. She tries to reconcile with Tenma, but he quietly rejects <br>
                her. Several years and three failed marriages later, she meets Inspector Lunge where she reminisces about her time with Tenma. Nostalgic, Eva <br>
                visits Tenma at the hospital and attempts to start over with him. When Eva is rejected again, she lashes out at him. She becomes an embittered <br>
                alcoholic, using money from divorce settlements to finance her lifestyle. At one point she has a budding romance with her gardener, but after <br>
                seeing his ex-wife visit his daughter at Christmas, Eva burns her house down in a drunken rage. Eva wanders throughout Germany and later becomes <br>
                a patient of Dr. Reichwein's. Although she does not suspect Tenma caused her father's death, she obsessively hopes to see him suffer in prison <br>
                in retaliation for his rejection of her. It is revealed that Eva followed Tenma nine years ago and saw Johan Liebert the night he murdered Adolf <br>
                Junkers. As such she becomes a target of Roberto's. Peter Čapek and "the Baby" hire Martin to bring her to Frankfurt and guard, where she tries <br>
                to mold Martin into a replica of Tenma. When Martin dies after a shootout, Eva is devastated. Although Tenma tells her to go by train to Munich <br>
                to meet with Dr. Reichwein and tell the police what she knows about Johan, instead she plans revenge on those responsible for Martin's death and <br>
                purchases a gun. Eva finds Kristoff Sievernich (partially responsible for Martin's death) and tries unsuccessfully to kill him. She is saved by <br>
                Tenma who wounds Sievernich. Eva is later seen with Dieter at Dr. Reichwein's house where she mentions that the police did not believe her story <br>
                that Johan Liebert was the culprit. During this time, Eva trades alcohol for cigarettes. At the end of the series, she becomes an interior decorator <br>
