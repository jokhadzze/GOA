                TV Girl is an American indie pop band from San Diego, California. TV Girl frequently samples songs <br> 
                and media from the 1960s in their music. The band employs a genre not easily defined, with major <br>
                inspiration from plunderphonics, indie pop, lo-fi and electronic music found in most of their works, <br>
                while taking on more trip-hop-like elements in other works. Altogether, the band proclaims themself <br>
                as a "hypnotic pop" group, due to their use of sampling, keyboards, and reverb effects. The band <br>
                was upset when their music was labeled "sun-drenched California pop," pointing out that there are no <br>
                lyrical allusions in their music that warrant the title. Lyrically, a majority of TV Girl's discography <br>
                revolves around love and ships.Their subject matter is nostalgic and sad, but simultaneously sarcastic <br>
                and humorous. Some motifs in the band's lyrics include heartbreak, cynicism, memories, cigarettes, <br> 
                hair, sex, women's first names, and loneliness.</p><br><br>

            <p style="color: navy; font-size: 25px;">songs I'll speak about:</p>

            <ul style="color: darkslateblue; font-size: 20px ;">
                <li>"NOt Allowed"</li>
                <li>"Cigarettes Out The Window"</li>
                <li>"Blue Hair"</li>
                <li>"Lovers Rock"</li>
            </ul> <br><br>

            <h2 style="color:  hotpink">Not Allowed</h2>
            <p style="color: lightpink">
                The song "Not Allowed" by TV Girl is a song about wanting to talk about sex but feeling like it's not <br> 
                socially acceptable. It speaks about how, despite the pressures and lies of society, one should be <br> 
                honest with who they are and follow their desires. The chorus of the song asks ‚Äúwe wanna talk about <br> 
                sex but we're not allowed‚Äù, showing how the main character feels a disconnect between the social <br> 
                norms and their own wants and needs. The song also expresses the idea of powerlessness, as the main <br> 
                character yearns for something but knows that it is not allowed. The song expresses this idea of power <br> 
                and control by talking about how someone needs to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù and ‚Äúget their face between [their] thighs‚Äù <br> 
                in order to experience what they desire. In the end, the song questions the idea of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs on your nasty <br> 
                old mind?‚Äù, signifying the idea that our wants, needs, and desires should be respected and there‚Äôs nothing <br> 
                wrong with pursuing them.</p> <br> <br>

            <h2 style="color: hotpink">Cigarettes Out The Window</h2>
            <p style="color:lightpink">
                At its core, 'Cigarettes out the Window' explores themes of love, loss, and the mundane yet poignant <br>
                rituals that maintain our connections to past relationships. Through the act of smoking cigarettes <br>
                out a window, the song delves into memories, habits, and the difficult process of letting go.The song <br>
                opens with a sample from Frankie Cosmos about smoking cigarettes out a window, immediately setting the <br>
                scene of someone entrenched in their habits and memories. The first verse introduces us to Liddy, who <br>
                smokes when she can't sleep, a habit that acts as both a physical and emotional crutch. Despite quitting <br>
                multiple times, she never truly breaks free, mirroring how difficult it is to let go of past loves and the <br>
                habits they leave behind. The chorus, repeated multiple times, emphasizes the cyclical nature of these <br>
                habits and memories, haunting the narrator. The second verse further explores the theme of inability to <br>
                escape the past, noting the persistent light in LA and the changing billboard as metaphors for change and <br>
                constancy, exemplified by Liddy's absence. The song concludes with a sample from 'Dangerously Yours,' <br>
                underscoring the dramatic, enduring emptiness left in the wake of lost love. This analysis reveals the <br>
                song's deep dive into the human condition, the struggle with personal habits, and the ghosts of past <br>
                relationships that linger in our routines.</p> <br><br>

                <h2 style="color:darkblue">Blue Hair</h2>
                <p style="color: navy">
                    At the heart of 'Blue Hair' lies the story of a relationship strained by personal growth and the  <br>
                    inevitable passage of time. The song masterfully juxtaposes the innocence and vibrancy of youth  <br>
                    with the somber realities that accompany maturing, using the metaphor of blue-dyed hair to symbolize  <br>
                    these themes. The opening verses of 'Blue Hair' set the scene with a conversation between the protagonist  <br>
                    and their partner, who is trying to grasp something as inherently subjective as 'being funny.' This quest  <br>
                    for understanding transitions into a reflection on identity, as seen in the lyrics about the blue hair  <br>
                    that seems vibrant in the sunlight but fades by night. This can be interpreted as a commentary on how  <br>
                    perceptions of ourselves and others can change under different circumstances, highlighting the ephemeral  <br>
                    nature of our youthful personas. The chorus captures a moment of transition, acknowledging the partner's  <br>
                    aging and the need to cut off her blue hair‚Äîwhich symbolizes letting go of her youthful, attention-seeking  <br>
                    behaviors. This act of cutting off the blue hair is a poignant metaphor for personal growth and the pain of  <br>
                    leaving a part of oneself behind in order to evolve. The subsequent verses further explore themes of identity  <br>
                    and perception, especially the societal expectations placed on women. The lyrics touch on the unfair judgments  <br>
                    based on appearances, hinting at a deeper societal critique. The line 'There's really no way of winning / If  <br>
                    in their eyes you'll always be a dumb blonde' suggests the futility of trying to change oneself to fit the molds  <br>
                    created by others. Towards the end of the song, we learn the partner has moved on, living 'with a boy who acts  <br>
                    his age.' This signifies not just the end of the relationship but also a move towards more mature, perhaps less  <br>
                    exciting, but genuine connections. The repetition of the chorus with a tinge of nostalgia expresses the complexity  <br>
                    of the emotions involved‚Äîmissing someone who isn't really gone but has changed beyond recognition.</p> <br> <br>

                <h2 style="color:crimson">Lovers Rock</h2>
                <p  style="color:firebrick">
                    'LOvers Rock' explores the ephemeral nature of romantic encounters, juxtaposing the ideal of lasting love <br>
                    against the reality of fleeting moments. The lyrics narrate the story of a temporary connection, hinting <br>
                    at the deeper complexities of love and attachment.The song 'Lovers Rock' by TV Girl intricately navigates <br>
                    through the layers of romantic escapades and the pursuit of love. From the opening verse, we delve into the <br>
                    protagonist's introspection on their romantic dynamics, questioning their significance to their partner amidst <br>
                    the allure of superficial charm ('Are you sick of me? Would you like to be?'). The chorus encapsulates the <br>
                    transient nature of love, painted with the imagery of a night where music and intoxication might lead to temporary <br>
                    closeness ('But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right...'). This fleetingness is echoed in the <br>
                    analogy of love burning like a cigarette, leaving nothing behind but remains. The second verse further romanticizes <br>
                    the intimate moment shared between two lovers, set against the backdrop of 'Lover‚Äôs Rock', hinting at a physical <br>
                    and emotional closeness that is as delicate as a record skipping. The sampled dialogue adds a layer of vintage romance, <br>
                    invoking a sense of nostalgia and longing for a love that is both daring and tender. Overall, the song weaves a narrative <br>
                    that is reflective, bittersweet, and deeply human, exploring the shadows of fleeting love and the yearning for something <br>
                    more enduring.</p> <br><br>
