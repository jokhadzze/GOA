            <h1>about Ellie</h1>
            <p>Ellie's most important, and unique, ability is her complete immunity to the fungus. <br>
               Due to a strange mutation in her brain that developed following her initial infection, <br>
               she became immune to the bites and spores of the infected. Despite this infection, <br>
               the infected do not recognize her as one of their own so they still attempt to kill her.<br>
               It is presumed that if she was properly studied, some form of cure or countermeasure for <br>
               the infection could be created. This is never clarified, however, since the study would <br>
               result in her death, which Joel did not allow. Ellie also mentioned that neither the <br>
               infection and immunity can be transferred to others though.</p>
