        <!-- about Coraline -->
        <p><b>Coraline</b> is a 2009 American <u>stop-motion animated dark fantasy horror film</u> written and directed by Henry Selick, <br>
            based on Neil Gaiman's novella of the same name.[5] Produced by LAIKA, as the studio's first feature film, it <br>
            features the voice talents of Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Keith David, <br>
            John Hodgman, Robert Bailey Jr., and Ian McShane. The musical score is by Bruno Coulais. The film tells the <br> 
            story of its eponymous character discovering an idealized alternate universe behind a secret door in her new <br>
            home, unaware that it contains something dark and sinister.<br> </p>

            <p>Just as Gaiman was finishing his novella in 2002, he met Selick and invited him to make a film adaptation, as Gaiman <br>
            was a fan of Selick's other stop-motion projects, The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and James and the Giant Peach (1996). <br>
            When Selick thought that a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", the screenplay was expanded. <br>
            Looking for a design different from that of most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator <br>
            Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. His biggest influences were on the color palette, <br>
            which was muted in the real world and more colorful in the Other World, as in The Wizard of Oz. To capture stereoscopy <br>
            for the 3D release, the animators shot each frame from two slightly apart camera positions. Production of the <br>
            stop-motion animation feature took place at a warehouse in Hillsboro, Oregon. <br></p>

            <p>The film was theatrically released in the United States on February 6, 2009, by Focus Features after a world premiere <br>
            at the Portland International Film Festival on February 5, and received critical acclaim. <i>It grossed $16.85 million</i> <br>
            during its opening weekend, ranking third at the box office, and by the end of its run had grossed over $124 million <br>
            worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing stop-motion film of all time after Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit: <br>
            The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The film won Annie Awards for Best Music in an Animated Feature Production, Best Character <br>
            Design in an Animated Feature Production and Best Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, and was nominated <br>
            for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It has developed <br>
            a cult following in the years since its release, and is considered one of the greatest animated films of all time. With <br>
            Coraline, Laika became the first company to make a feature-length film using replacement faces made by a 3D printer.</p>
