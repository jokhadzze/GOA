        <p>Tomb Raider, known as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider from 2001 to 2008, is a media franchise that originated <br>
            with an action-adventure video game series created by British video game developer Core Design. <br>
            The franchise is currently owned by CDE Entertainment; it was formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, <br>
            then by Square Enix Europe after Square Enix's acquisition of Eidos in 2009 until Embracer Group purchased <br>
            the intellectual property alongside Eidos in 2022. The franchise focuses on the fictional British archaeologist <br>
            Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. <br>
            Gameplay generally focuses on exploration, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, <br>
            and fighting enemies. Additional media has been developed for the franchise in the form of film adaptations, <br>
            comics and novels.</p>

            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            
            <p>The gameplay of Tomb Raider is primarily based around an action-adventure framework, with Lara navigating <br>
                environments and solving mechanical and environmental puzzles, in addition to fighting enemies and avoiding traps. <br>
                These puzzles, primarily set within ancient tombs and temples, can extend across multiple rooms and areas within a level.<br>
                Lara can swim through water, a rarity in games at the time that has continued through the series. According to original <br>
                software engineer and later studio manager Gavin Rummery, the original set-up of interlinking rooms was inspired by <br>
                Egyptian multi-roomed tombs, particularly the tomb of Tutankhamun.[67] The feel of the gameplay was intended to evoke <br>
                that of the 1989 video game Prince of Persia.[79] In the original games, Lara utilised a "bulldozer" steering set-up, <br>
                with two buttons pushing her forward and back and two buttons steering her left and right, and in combat Lara automatically <br>
                locked onto enemies when they came within range. The camera automatically adjusts depending on Lara's action, but defaults <br>
                to a third-person perspective in most instances. This basic formula remained unchanged through the first series of games. <br>
                Angel of Darkness added stealth elements.</p>
