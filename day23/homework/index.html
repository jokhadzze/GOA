        <h1> Battle of Didgori </h1>
        
        <p>The Battle of Didgori (Georgian: დიდგორის ბრძოლა, romanized: didgoris brdzola) was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of <br>
            Georgia and the Seljuk Empire at the narrow place of Didgori, 40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121. The large Muslim army, <br>
            under the command of Ilghazi, was unable to maneuver and suffered a devastating defeat due to King David IV of Georgia's effective <br>
            military tactics. <br>

            The battle at Didgori was the culmination of the entire Georgian–Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' reconquest <br>
            of Tbilisi in 1122. Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi. The victory at Didgori inaugurated <br>
            the medieval Georgian Golden Age and is celebrated in The Georgian Chronicles as a (Georgian: ძლევაჲ საკვირველი dzlevay <br>
            sak'virveli lit. the "miraculous victory"). Modern Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 festival <br>
            known as Didgoroba ("[the day] of Didgori").</p>

            <h2> the battle </h2>

            <p>King David could not allow Ilghazi to unite with the Tbilisi Muslims, so he decided to intercept him on his way there. <br>
                He used a strategy of surprise and to entice the enemy step-by-step into a trap. He chose a mountainous and wooded area <br>
                near the Didgori Mountain range, situated between Manglisi and Tbilisi, to attack. "On August 11, 1121, King David led <br>
                his army along the Nichbisi valley from the ancient capital of Mtskheta and divided his troops into two parts, one under <br>
                his personal command and the other smaller group under his son Demetrius I, hidden in reserve behind the nearby heights <br>
                with orders to attack the flank at a given signal." <br>

                The course of the battle is differently related in the contemporary historical records. According to the Arab chronicler <br>
                Ibn al-Athir, David sent a small Kipchak detachment of his men in order to simulate negotiation. The Muslims thought that <br>
                the small detachment had left the Georgian army seeking protection, so the Muslims did not regard them as a threat. <br>
                Meanwhile, the Georgians successfully managed to deploy a large portion of their force where they would almost encircle <br>
                the enemy in a pincer movement. Their opponents remained unaware of such activities. Upon approaching the Seljuq leaders, <br>
                the deserters, using the self-confidence of the Muslims to their advantage, attacked them with arrows, killing every Seljuq <br>
                commander in sight and others who were attending the meeting. <br>
                
                While this was going on, David ordered a frontal attack on the enemy vanguard with his crusader knights which not only <br>
                devastated the enemy's forward lines, but also entangled the Seljuq archers in close combat, effectively taking out a <br>
                crucial component of Ilghazi's force. This trick resulted in chaos and panic among the Muslims. The Georgians then began <br>
                to quickly advance on the flanks from the western side of the mountain in full formation. Ilghazi and his son-in-law both <br>
                survived the attack on the vanguard, but were severely injured during the fight and withdrew from the battlefield, leaving <br>
                the Seljuq army virtually leaderless. <br>
                
                
                Section of the Didgori monument with swords stuck in the ground <br>
                The majority of his commanders were either injured or killed, which caused confusion and probably resulted in a lack of <br>
                adequate response to the chaotic situation. King David didn't hesitate and personally led the Georgian right flank, ordering <br>
                 his heavy cavalry to ride straight into the seemingly disorganised Seljuk left flank, which was trying to reinforce the <br>
                  vanguard. Having the advantage of moving downhill, the charge of the Georgian cavalry proved very effective. <br>
                
                Almost simultaneously the left wing, under the command of David's son Demetrius, struck the Seljuk right flank also with heavy <br>
                cavalry. When the Georgian infantry joined the fight, the Seljuq troops started to panic and retreated en masse through the huge <br>
                gap in their army's rearguard, which wasn't engaged in the battle. This provoked large numbers of uninvolved Seljuq troops to <br>
                flee as well, causing a massive rout, while their vanguard was completely annihilated. According to a Georgian chronicler, <br>
                King David’s troops pursued them for three days “putting all of them to the sword and leaving them to the carnivorous beasts <br>
                and birds of the mountains and plains” of the Manglisi Valley. <br>
                
                "Terrible and savage slaughter of the enemy troops ensued and the [enemy] corpses filled up the rivers and covered all valleys
                and cliffs." <br>
                
                — Matthew of Edessa <br>
                With the Kipchaks joining in, the final remnants of Seljuq resistance crumbled and joined the rout. The battle was decided <br>
                within three hours with the Seljuq army overrun, leaving a very large number of dead, injured, prisoners, and booty. Fleeing <br>
                remnants were constantly pursued and run down for several days so that they wouldn't have time or opportunity to regroup or <br>
                commence any other move. <br>
                
                Aside from those accounts, it has also been suggested that confronted by a vanguard of the large invading force, David had to <br>
                rely on the advantages the nearby terrain offered to disguise his troop movements. The Seljuk cavalry was provoked or tricked <br>
                into a relatively narrow pass where they probably had not much room to maneuver. As these were cut off from the rest of <br>
                Ilghazi's army, the Georgians were easily able to take them out with spears, pikes, and light infantry using bows and <br>
                javelins. The rest of the coalition army was probably forced to climb slopes to attack the Georgian army's main body, <br>
                while being constantly struck at the flanks by heavy cavalry. After a while, those tactics broke the fighting will of <br>
                the Muslim army, which was soon routed. Ilghazi reportedly received an injury to his head when a hundred crusaders managed <br>
                to break through his lines, rushing towards the Seljuq command banner</p>
